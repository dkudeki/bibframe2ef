jstor_sample.json - JSTOR's sample as it exists on GitHub
jstor_sample_expanded.json - Un-compacted version of sample, created with JSON-LD Playground 1.1
jstor_sample_ef_context.json - Compacted JSTOR sample using ef_context.json in the JSON-LD Playground 1.1
ef_context.json - Updated context document we are testing out
htrc_sample_raw.json - Sample HTRC record before it has been compacted/framed
htrc_sample.json - Sample HTRC record after it has been framed using ef_context.json

Issues:
	- htrc:seq, htrc:pageCount, schema:inLanguage, schema:propertyID not being compacted
		- Solutions:	
			For JSTOR sample we were able to compact schema:propertyID to propertyID by adding the line "propertyID": { "@id": "propertyID", "@type": "Text" }," to the context document being used to un-compact he initial sample.

			For HTRC sample we were able to compact schema:propertyID to propertyID by adding '"@type": "http://schema.org/Text"' to the properties of a propertyID object in htrc_sample_raw.json
	- schema:hasPart is being mapped to "body", "features", "footer" and "header", but because of how the context document is evaluated, all instances of schema:hasPart will map to "body"
		- Solution:
			HTRC will have to mint subclasses (sub-properties, I'm not sure what terminology we decided was correct) to reflect each of these parts, so they will remain unique
	- JSTOR's "about" field should map to "metadata", but we are already mapping "@graph" to "metadata" and JSON-LD doesn't appear to support mapping multiple fileds to a single value. We tried setting "metadata" equal to an array of strings and an array of objects containing the strings as thier "@id"s, but neither worked in the JSON-LD Playground 1.1
